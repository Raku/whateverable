## How to contribute to Whateverable

🍕 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🍕


If you have a question that is not covered here, just
talk to a human on
[#perl6 or #whateverable](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6,#whateverable)
IRC channel on freenode.


Looking for a bug to squash? See
[issues marked as low-hanging fruit](https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).


### Reporting bugs

If you found a bug, feel free to
[file an issue](https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/issues/new).
Include as much information as you feel necessary.

Note that issues are only closed once there is a fix *and* at least
one test. Tickets that need tests are marked with
[`testneeded`](https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atestneeded)
label.


### Submitting changes

Generally, code contributions are accepted as
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
Let us know if that is not suitable for you and you want to contribute
in a different way (e.g. by mailing a patch).

To test your changes, check out
[wiki/Installation](https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/wiki/Installation)
for instructions on installing and running the bots.

Coding conventions are not enforced, but try to keep your changes
consistent with code around them. For example, you'll find that
unicode quotes (`“”`, `‘’`, `｢｣`) are preferred over ASCII quotes
(`""`, `''`), but pull requests will be accepted regardless of which
quotes are used. The code will be consistified later in bulk.


### Do you want more information about the bots?

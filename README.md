## Whateverable

The Whateverables are a collection of IRC bots primarily useful for
Raku developers. They are written in Raku and are based on
[IRC::Client](https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-IRC-Client). Many of
the use cases involve running Raku code using pre-built versions of
the [Rakudo](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo) compiler for
each commit.
